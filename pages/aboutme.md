My name is Alexandre Lutt. I am currently a first-year master's student at Ecole des Ponts ParisTech, where I study Applied Mathematics and Computer Science. I also love baking (and cooking in general) during my free time, so feel free to have a look at my recipes [here](https://alexandrelutt.github.io/pages/pastry/).
