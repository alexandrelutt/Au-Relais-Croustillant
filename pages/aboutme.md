<p>My name is Alexandre Lutt. I am currently a French engineering student at <a href="https://www.ecoledesponts.fr">Ecole des Ponts ParisTech</a>. I've always loved cooking with my mom when I was young, and everything changed when I worked as a pastry intern in the 3 Michelin-star restaurant <a href="https://www.closdessens.com">Le Clos des Sens</a> last summer. I learned a lot, and now I want to share my passion with other amateurs from all around the world. Feel free to have a look at my recipes <a href="https://alexandrelutt.github.io/pages/pastry/">here</a>, or check my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/au_relais_croustillant/">Instagram</a>!</p>
