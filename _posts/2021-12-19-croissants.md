Honestly, who doesn't like fresh croissants? They're not that difficult to make, plus you'll get to perfume your whole kitchen with butter...

![Croissants](/assets/img/croissants_2.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

For 12 croissants, you'll need:

- 520g of flour
- 160mL of water
- 100mL of whole milk
- 10g of instant yeast
- 10g of sea salt
- 75g of sugar
- 290g of butter (minimum 82% fat)

<div style="text-align: justify">
<p> Start by mixing the flour, yeast, water, milk, salt, sugar until it forms a dough. Add 40g of your butter, and knead your dough until you get a nice and elastic ball with a smooth surface. Cover your dough with a wet cloth, and let it rise at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours, or until it has doubled in size. While it is resting, take the rest of your butter, form a 25cmx25cm square, (I suggest using baking sheets) and put it in the fridge so it stays cold. Then, degas your dough, and roll it down until you get a rectangle with length twice as long as the side of your square of butter, and with the same width. Let it rest in the fridge for 30 minutes.</p>
<p> Now, it's time for the "hard" part. Start by encasing your butter in your dough, then do what is called a double turn: roll out your dough in one direction, until it is 7mm thick. The, fold both ends of your dough until they meet at the middle, and fold it one more time. It should somehow look like a wallet. Let your dough rest in the fridge for 20min, so the butter doesn't melt. </p>
<p> We're almost there. Now, you're going to do a simple turn. Roll out your dough in the other direction until it is 1cm thick, fold one end of the dough to the third of its total length, and fold the other end on top of the first one. Let your dough rest in the fridge for at least 20min. Then, roll out your dough one last time until it's 4mm thick, and cut 30cmx8cm triangles. Stretch them out, and roll them so you get nice and even croissants.</p>
<p> Let your croissants rise at room temperature for 2 hours. Once they're proofed, preheat your oven at 180Â°C, and mix 2 eggs with 15mL of liquid cream. Spray some of this mixture on your croissants, and bake them for 20 minutes or until they have a bright golden colour. Let them cool on a kitchen grid until they reach room temperature. Congratulations, you just made your first croissants, enjoy!</p>
