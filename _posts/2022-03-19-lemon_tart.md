Looking for a sweet and sour desert for tonight's dinner, or you don't know what to do with your leftovers lemons? I got you! 

![Lemon tart](/assets/img/lemon_tart.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

You'll need:

- 1 egg
- 100g of soft butter
- 15g of almond powder
- 200g of flour
- 60g of icing sugar
- 1 pinch of sea salt

For the lemon custard, you'll need:

- 3 lemons
- 150g of sugar
- 3 eggs
- 75g of butter
- 12g of cornstarch

<div style="text-align: justify">
<p> Start by making your dough. Mix together the soft butter and the icing sugar until you get a creamy consistency. Add your egg, mix well and add the flour, the salt and the almond powder. Don't be shy, you can use your hands to form the dough at this point. Once you get something homogenous, roll it down between two baking sheets, and let it cool down for 30 minutes to 1 hour in the fridge. Once it's done, preheat your oven at 170Â°C, form your pie and bake it for 15 to 20 minutes, or until it has a nice golden colour.</p>
<p> While the pie is baking, let's make our lemon custard. Get the zest of two lemons, and press the juice of 3 of them, and put it on the heat. Then, mix the sugar, eggs and cornstarch, and gently poor the boiling lemon mixture on top of it. Put everything back on the heat, and mix until it starts to thicken. Mix again for 2 minutes, add the butter and let your custard cool down in a separate bowl. Once it has reached room temperature, poor it on the baked pie, and let it firm up in the fridge for a couple hours. Congratulations, your desert is ready! </p>
