This is the classic French recipe for the *flan p창tissier* It takes a bit of patience, but trust me, it's totally worth it...

![Flan](/assets/img/flan.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

For the dough, you'll need:

- 1 egg
- 100g of soft butter
- 15g of almond powder
- 200g of flour
- 60g of icing sugar
- 1 pinch of sea salt

<div style="text-align: justify">
<p> Start by cutting your butter in small cubes, and mix in  the icing sugar until you get a shiny cream. Then, add your egg. At this point, you should get something that looks like scrambled eggs (it's not, don't worry). Add your dry ingredients, and gently knead your dough until it comes together. Roll it down between two baking sheets and let it rest in the fridge while you make the custard. </p>
</div>

For the custard, you'll need:

- 30cL of whole milk
- 30cL of cream
- 1 teaspoon of vanilla seeds
- 5 eggs
- 60g of cornstarch
- 170g of sugar

<div style="text-align: justify">
<p> For the custard, bring the milk and the vanilla to a simmer. In the meantime, mix the eggs with the sugar and gradually add the cornstarch (it is important to add the cornstarch in 3 or 4 times, unless you want to have lumps in your <i>flan</i>...). Once the milk is hot, remove your saucepan from the heat, add it to your eggs along with the cream, and poor everything	back into your saucepan on medium heat. Whisk without stopping until you get a creamy consistency, and that's it for the custard! </p>
<p> Preheat your oven at 190째C and put your dough in a greased and floured cake pan. Do not forget to prick it BEFORE pouring your custard... Then, bake your <i>flan</i> for 20 minutes, then increase the temperature to 210째C and let your <i>flan</i> bake for 10 more minutes. Once it's done, let it cool at room temperature for at least 30 minutes, and unmold it. Finally, let it rest in the fridge for at least 2 hours (ideally overnight) and it's done! Congratulations, you just made your first <i>flan p창tissier</i>!</p>
