It's hot outside and you need a fresh and fruity desert? I got the perfect recipe for you!

![Pavlova](/assets/img/pavlova.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

For a 6 people-serving pavlova, you'll need:

- 100g of egg whites
- 200g of sugar
- 200g of red berries

For the <i>crème Chantilly</i>, you'll need:

- 100mL of liquid cream
- 15g of powdered sugar

<div style="text-align: justify">
<p> Start by making the French meringue, by beating the egg whites, and slowly incorporating the sugar, until it formes soft peaks. Then, put your meringue in a piping bag, and create two disks on some baking sheets, and bake for one hour at 90°C, and let it cool down completely before making your <i> crème Chantilly </i>. </p> 
<p> For the <i> crème Chantilly </i>, beat the cream and slowly incorporate the powdered sugar. Then, put it in a piping bag, and decorate your Pavlova with your red berries and LOTS (it's important) of <i> crème Chantilly </i>. Enjoy! </p>
