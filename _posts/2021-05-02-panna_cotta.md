Looking for an easy Italian dessert recipe for summer dinners? You're in the right place!

For 6 panna cotta, you'll need:

- 60cL of liquid cream
- 80g of sugar
- 3 gelatin sheets
- 1 vanilla pod
- 200g of red berries

<div style="text-align: justify">
<p> For the red fruits coulis, start by cutting the fruits into small pieces, and cook them in a saucepan with 20g of sugar, until you get a fruit puree. Mix it well and let it cool at room temperature. </p>
<p> For the panna cotta, place your gelatine sheets in a bowl of frozen water. While it is rehydrating, bring the cream and the vanilla seeds to a simmer. Once you see bubbles, remove your saucepan from the heat, add the gelatine and mix well. Poor your mixture into individual verrines, and leave them in the fridge for at least 5 hours. Just before serving, add your red fruits coulis and a few berries, and you're done! </p>
