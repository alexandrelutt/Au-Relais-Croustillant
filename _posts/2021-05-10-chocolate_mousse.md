You have guests coming tonight and you didn't have time to bake some fancy dessert? With this quick chocolate mousse recipe, I got you!

![Chocolate mousse](/assets/img/mousse_chocolat.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

For 4 people, you'll need:

- 3 eggs
- 80g of dark chocolate
- 20g of hazelnut powder
- 4cL of whole milk
- 15g of sugar
- 1 pinch of sea salt

<div style="text-align: justify">
<p> Start by melting your chocolate with the milk in a bain-marie. Once your mixture is homogeneous, add the hazelnut powder and the yolks until you get a shiny ganache. Then, beat the egg whites until soft peaks form, and add the sugar and the salt. Keep on beating until you get stiff peaks. Carefully add your whites to your ganache (ideally in 2 or 3 times), and you should get the perfect airy chocolate mousse. Poor it in individual verrines, and let them rest in the fridge for at least 3 hours. </p>
<p> Before serving, grate a bit of dark chocolate and/or hazelnut on your mousses. Congratulations, you just saved your dinner!</p>
