Here you'll find the best chocolate chip walnut cookies you'll ever taste. Try it and tell me what you think!

For 18 regular-sized cookies, you'll need:

- 200g of butter
- 115g of sugar
- 130g of brown sugar 
- 1 pinch of fleur de sel
- 2 eggs
- 300g of all-purpose flour
- 250g of dark chocolate
- 100g of roasted hazelnuts

For the salted-butter caramel, you'll need:

- 80g of sugar
- 40g of salted butter
- 100mL of cream

<div style="text-align: justify">
<p> Start by melting the butter in a pan until it reaches a golden brown color. This is callled a beurre noisette and it enhances the flavor of your cookies while keeping them moist and doughy. Add both sugars and the salt and mix until they are fully incorporated. Then, add the eggs, mix again, and once you have something homogeneous, add the flour. After quite a bit of mixing, you should get your cookie dough. DO NOT EAT IT JUST YET! I promise we're almost there. Just let your dough rest in the fridge for at least 2 hours (but ideally overnight). </p>
<p> While the dough is resting, let's make our salted butter caramel. Put your sugar on medium high heat, and don't touch it until it forms a nice caramel. Then, carefully add your preheated cream and mix well. There should be bubbles, it's completely normal. Once things have calmed down a little, add your butter, lower the head and keep mixing. Once you reach your second boiling point, you can pour your caramel in a small jar or in a piping bag, let it cool down at room temperature and keep in the fridge! See? It was easier than you expected! </p>
<p> Finally, bake your cookies at 190Â°C during 10-12 minutes. They should be really soft, it's completely normal, don't worry! Let them cool a few minutes at room temperature, add your dark chocolate, salted butter caramel, roasted hazelnuts, and a pinch of fleur de sel, and that's it! It wasn't that difficult, right? </p>
