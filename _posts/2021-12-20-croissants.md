Honestly, who doesn't like fresh croissants? They're not that difficult to make, plus you'll get to perfume your whole kitchen with butter...

![Croissants](/assets/img/croissants.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

For 14 croissants, you'll need:

- 500g of flour
- 210mL of water
- 1/2 egg
- 23g of fresh yeast
- 10g of sea salt
- 50g of sugar
- 10g of honey
- 235g of butter

<div style="text-align: justify">
<p> Start by mixing the flour, the yeast, the water, the egg, the salt, the sugar and the honey, until it forms a dough. Add 35g of your butter, and knead your dough until you get a nice and elastic ball with a smooth surface. Cover your dough with a wet cloth, and let it rise at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours, or until it has doubled in size. While it is resting, take the rest of your butter, form a 25cm*25cm square, (I suggest using baking sheets) and put it in the fridge so it stays cold. Then, degas your dough, and roll it down until you get a rectangle with length twice as long as the side of your square of butter, and with the same width. Let it rest in the fridge for 30 minutes.</p>
<p> Now, it's time for the "hard" part. Start by encasing your butter in your dough, then do what is called a double turn: roll out your dough in one direction, until it is 7mm thick. The, fold both ends of your dough until they meet at the middle, and fold it one more time. It should somehow look like a wallet. Let your dough rest in the fridge for 15min, so the butter doesn't melt. </p>
<p> We're almost there. Now, you're going to do a simple turn. Roll out your dough in the other direction until it is 1cm thick, fold one end of the dough to the third of its total length, and fold the other end on top of the first one. Roll out your dough one last time until it's 4mm thick, and cut triangles with 8cm bases. Stretch them out, and roll them so you get nice and even croissants.</p>
<p> Let your croissants rise at room temperature for 2 hours. Once they're proofed, preheat your oven at 175Â°C, and mix 2 eggs with 15mL of liquid cream. Spray some of this mixture on your croissants, and bake them for 20 minutes or until they have a bright golden colour. Congratulations, you just made your first croissants, enjoy!</p>
