Looking for a rich and flavorful desert for tonight's dinner, or you're just craving chocolate and salted butter caramel? I got you! 

![Chocolate pie](/assets/img/tarte_chocolat.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

For 8 small pies, you'll need:

- 1 egg
- 100g of soft butter
- 15g of almond powder
- 200g of flour
- 60g of icing sugar
- 1 pinch of sea salt

For the filing, you'll need:

- 100g of cream cheese
- 200g of icing sugar

<div style="text-align: justify">
<p> Start by mixing the flour, the baking soda, the grated carrots and the oil. In a separate bowl, mix the eggs and the sugars, and add this mixture to your dry ingredients. Add your spices, the salt, poor your mixture in a greased cake mold, and bake one hour at 150Â°C. </p>
<p> While your cake is cooling off, prepare your icing by mixing the cream cheese and the icing sugar. Unmold your cake when it reaches room temperature, add your icing and you're done, congrats! </p>
