For 10 muffins, you'll need:

- 115g of softened butter
- 100g of sugar
- 50g of brown sugar
- 2 eggs
- 120g of liquid cream
- a pinch of <i>fleur de sel</i>
- 220g of all-purpose flour
- 8g of baking powder
- 60mL of milk
- 250g of blueberries

For the topping, you'll need:
- 2 teaspoons of brown sugar

<div style="text-align: justify">
<p> Start by preheating your oven at 220°C. Then, mix the softened butter mix both sugars, add the eggs one by one, and then the cream. In a separate bowl, mix the flour, the salt and the baking powder. Once you get an homogeneous mixture, add the flour mix to the main preparation. When everything is incorporated, finally add the milk. Lightly coat your blueberries with cornstarch (so they don't drop at the bottom of your muffins), and gently fold them into to the mix.</p>
<p> Then, fill your cups with your preparation, add some brown sugar on top, and bake your muffins for 5 minutes at 220°C, and then 15 minutes at 200°C. Let them cool down to room temperature, and here you are! You're already done with your homemade blueberry muffins, congrats!</p>
