For 18 regular-sized cookies, you'll need:

- 200g of butter
- 4g of instant coffee
- 115g of sugar
- 130g of brown sugar 
- 1 pinch of fleur de sel
- 2 eggs
- 300g of all-purpose flour
- 250g of hazelnut dark chocolate
- 100g of roasted hazelnuts

For the hazelnut praliné, you'll need:

- 100g of sugar
- 100g of roasted hazelnut

<div style="text-align: justify">
<p> Start by melting the butter in a pan along with the instant coffee until it reaches a golden brown color. This is callled a beurre noisette and it enhances the flavor of your cookies while keeping them moist and doughy. Add both sugars and the salt and mix until they are fully incorporated. Then, add the eggs, mix again, and once you have something homogeneous, add the flour. After quite a bit of mixing, you should get your cookie dough. DO NOT EAT IT JUST YET! I promise we're almost there. Just let your dough rest in the fridge for at least 2 hours (but ideally overnight). </p>
<p> While the dough is resting, let's make our hazelnut praliné. Put your sugar on medium high heat, and don't touch it until it forms a nice caramel. Then, carefully poor it on your roasted hazelnut on a baking sheet, and let it cool down for 10 minutes. Then, brake it into pieces and mix well for 10 minutes until it forms a liquid praliné. See? It was easier than you expected! </p>
<p> Finally, bake your cookies at 190°C during 10-12 minutes. They should be really soft, it's completely normal, don't worry! Let them cool a few minutes at room temperature, add your chocolate, praliné, roasted hazelnuts, and a pinch of fleur de sel, and that's it! It wasn't that difficult, right? </p>
