For 8 people, you'll need:
- 500g of flour
- 110g of sugar
- 130g of melted butter
- 12g of baking soda
- 4 eggs
- 600mL of (any) milk 
- 1/2 lemon
- 500g of berries 

<div style="text-align: justify">
<p> For your red fruit coulis, juste chop your berries into small cubes, and cook them with 50g of sugar over medium heat until you get a fruit puree. Blend your puree and let it cool in the fridge while you make the pancakes. </p>
<p> For your pancakes, start by mixing the flour, the rest (60g) of your sugar and the baking soda. Add the eggs, mix well, and add the melted butter. Once your mixture is homogeneous, add the milk in 3 or 4 times while keeping on whisking so you don't get any plums. Add the juice of your lemon, and if you have time to, let your mix rest in the fridge for 30 minutes. </p>
<p> Finally, bake your pancakes in a preheated pan with a knob of butter. Flip them as soon as you start to see small air bubbles at the surface of your pancakes. Once you flipped them, just wait 30 to 40 seconds and they should come out perfect! Add some red fruit coulis, a few berries, and you're done! </p>
