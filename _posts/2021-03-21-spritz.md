For 16 biscuits, you'll need:

- 1 egg white
- 190g of soft butter
- 75g of icing sugar
- 225g of flour
- 150g of dark chocolate
- 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract
- 1 pinch of sea salt

<div style="text-align: justify">
<p> Start by preheating your oven at 180°C. Mix well the butter and the icing sugar, until you reach a creamy consistency. Then, add the egg white, the sal and the vanilla extract. Once everything is well mixed, add the flour (in 2 or 3 times). Once is mixture is homogeneous, pour it in a piping bag fitted with a fluted tip, then proceed to create "S" shapes on a baking sheet. Bake for 13 minutes or until your biscuits are golden brown. </p>
<p> Let them cool at room temperature, and melt your chocolate in a bain-marie. Finally, dip your spritz in the chocolate (which should be at 30°C) and leave them in the fridge for a few minutes. Congratulations, you made your first spritz! I'm sure everybody's going to love them! </p>
