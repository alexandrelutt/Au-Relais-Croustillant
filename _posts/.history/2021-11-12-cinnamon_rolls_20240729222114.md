For 10 cinnamon rolls, you'll need:

- 600g of flour
- 2 eggs
- 230mL of warm whole milk
- 100g of sugar
- 10g of instant yeast
- 220g of brown sugar
- 20g of cinnamon

For the icing, you'll need:

- 200g of powdered sugar
- 90g of cream cheese
- 50g of soft butter
- a splash of lemon juice

<div style="text-align: justify">
<p> Prepare the yeast in 5cl of warm water. In the mixer bowl or in a large bowl, mix the ingredients and knead for 15 minutes. Cover and let rest for 1 hour until the dough doubles in size. </p>
<p> Then, butter and flour a round or rectangular baking pan. On your floured work surface, roll out the dough into a rectangular shape. In a bowl, mix the butter, sugar, and spices. Spread this mixture over the entire surface, and roll the dough lengthwise. Cut into ten small rolls, place them in the pan, cover with a cloth, and let them rise at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours, or until they have doubled in size.</p>
<p> When they are proofed, preheat the oven to 180Â°C,  brush the rolls with milk, and bake them for 20 minutes, or until they are slightly golden. Let them cool down, and mix the powdered sugar with the cream cheese, the soft butter and the lemon juice to create a spread. Finally, pour it over the warm rolls, and enjoy!</p>
