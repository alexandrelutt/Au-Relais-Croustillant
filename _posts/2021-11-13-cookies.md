Here you'll find the best chocolate chip walnut cookies you'll ever taste. Try it and tell me what you think!

![Cookies](/assets/img/cookies.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

For 30 regular-sized cookies, you'll need:

- 200g of butter
- 115g of sugar
- 130g of brown sugar 
- 1 pinch of fleur de sel
- 2 eggs
- 300g of all-purpose flour
- 250g of chocolate chips
- 100g of walnuts

<div style="text-align: justify">
<p> Start by mixing the butter and both sugars until you get a creamy consistency. Then, add the eggs, and, once you have something homogeneous, add the flour. After quite a bit of mixing, you should get your cookie dough. DO NOT EAT IT JUST YET! I promise we're almost there. Add your chocolate chips and your walnuts, and let your dough rest in the fridge at least 2 hours (ideally overnight). </p>
<p> Finally, cook your cookies at 190Â°C during 10 minutes. They should be really soft, it's completely normal, don't worry! Let them cool a few minutes at room temperature, and that's it! It wasn't that difficult, right? </p>
