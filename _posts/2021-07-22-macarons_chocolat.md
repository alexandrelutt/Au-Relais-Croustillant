You love macarons but you think they're too hard to make all by yourself? Don't worry, it's not, and I'm going to help you make the fanciest desert ever.

For 32 macarons, you'll need:

- 3 egg whites
- 1 pinch of sea salt
- 60g of sugar
- 125g of hazelnut powder
- 220g of icing sugar
- 100g of dark chocolate
- 200mL of cream
- 20g of butter

<div style="text-align: justify">
<p> Start by mixing and sieve the hazelnut powder and the icing sugar. Then, Ensuite, beat the egg whites until soft peaks form, and add the sugar and the salt. Keep on beating until you get stiff peaks. Carefully add your meringue to your dry ingredients and push your mixture on the edges of your bowl until it forms a ribbon. Preheat your hoven at 140Â°C, and form your macarons on a baking sheet, using a piping bag. </p>
<p> Then, let your macarons exposed to air during one hour, or until a thin and dry crust forms on the surface. Then, bake your macarons for 19 minutes and let them cool on a wire rack. </p>
<p> For the chocolate ganache, bring the cream to a simmer, and pour it on the roughly chopped dark chocolate. Add the butter, mix well without adding any air bubble (ideally with a hand blender), and then let your ganache chill in the fridge. </p>
<p> Once the macarons are at room temperature, fill them up with your chocolate ganache, and you're done! Macarons taste even better after a night in the fridge, so don't hesitate to make them 24 hours before serving! </p>
